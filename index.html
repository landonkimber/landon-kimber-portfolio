            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Landon Kimber! I am 20 years old and from Ogden, Utah. <img class="right" src="assets/images/landon-snowbasin.JPG" alt="Picture of Landon and his loyal dog, Doug exploring the backside of Mt. Ogden"></img> I was born and raised in Ogden
                and have lived here my entire life so naturally I came to love every corner of the city and every acre of the country surrounding it. I graduated from Ogden High School, as the president of the National Honors Society and lettering in basketball.
                After high school, I finished my general associates degree with Weber State University and am currently enrolled in University of Utah's EdEx coding bootcamp. I really enjoy coding 
                and the challenge and problem solving that comes with it!<img class="left" src="assets/images/landon-uintas.JPG" alt = "Landon and his best friends with their gear before they backpack into the Uinta Mountains"></img> When I have freetime away from school and work, being from Utah, I very much enjoy being outdoors and everything that comes with it.
                Some of my favorite hobbies outdoors include, hiking, fly-fishing, skiing, backpacking, camping, and anything else that'll let me breathe the cold fresh mountain air. Aside's from outdoors, I do also very much enjoy
                watching the NBA, playing video games, but most of all, sleeping! Please take a look around this site for references for my current work and progress within the beautiful world of full stack web development!</p>
